## 📖 Overview

The quest for fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) capable of navigating complex real-world scenarios with human-like understanding and responsiveness. In this paper, we introduce **Dolphins**, a novel vision-language model architected to imbibe human-like driving abilities. **Dolphins** is adept at processing multimodal inputs comprising video (or image) data, text instructions, and historical control signals to generate informed outputs corresponding to the provided instructions. Building upon the open-sourced pretrained Vision-Language Model, OpenFlamingo, we tailored **Dolphins** to the driving domain by constructing driving-specific instruction data and conducting instruction tuning. Through the utilization of the BDD-X dataset, we designed and consolidated four distinct AV tasks into **Dolphins** to foster a holistic understanding of intricate driving scenarios. As a result, the distinctive features of **Dolphins** are delineated into two dimensions: (1) the ability to provide a comprehensive understanding of complex and long-tailed open-world driving scenarios and solve a spectrum of AV tasks, and (2) the emergence of human-like capabilities including gradient-free rapid learning and adaptation via in-context learning, reflection and error recovery, and interoperability.

In this repo, we provide **Dolphins** code. This codebase is under [MIT License](LICENSE).
